### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

CSS was a big win for me on this project. I feel like it was the most fun to mess around with and the concept generally came naturally to me. That's not to say it was easy! The workload of this project compared to last was not as big, so I was able to balance it out easier with whatever else was going on in my life like chores and some socializing with friends, so that's another win. The addToFavorites function was a tough one to do.. I'd like to go back to that code block and try to get a better understanding of what it's doing / why it works. Specifically the line: if (!favorites.includes(message) && message.trim() !== "") ... the message.trim and not operator ...
